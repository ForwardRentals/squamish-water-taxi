          <p>Squamish, British Columbia sits at the northern tip of <strong>Howe Sound</strong> -- one of the most spectacular fjords on Canada's west coast. While most visitors know Squamish for rock climbing at the Stawamus Chief or mountain biking in the Sea to Sky corridor, the real hidden gem is getting out on the water. Whether you're looking for a <strong>scenic boat ride</strong>, a <strong>guided boat tour</strong>, or a <strong>boat rental in Squamish</strong>, there's no better way to experience the stunning coastal mountains, islands, and wildlife of Howe Sound.</p>

          <h2 id="why-boat-tours-squamish">Why Squamish Is the Best Place for Boat Tours in BC</h2>

          <p>Located just 45 minutes north of Vancouver along the Sea to Sky Highway, Squamish is the gateway to <strong>Howe Sound</strong> -- a fjord stretching over 40 kilometres from Horseshoe Bay to Squamish. This dramatic waterway is flanked by towering mountains, dotted with islands like Anvil Island and Gambier Island, and home to an incredible diversity of marine wildlife.</p>

          <p>What makes <strong>boat tours in Squamish</strong> so special:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dramatic scenery</strong> -- Snow-capped mountains rise directly from the water, creating a landscape unlike anything else near Vancouver</li>
            <li><strong>Abundant wildlife</strong> -- Bald eagles, harbour seals, sea lions, porpoises, and even occasional orca sightings</li>
            <li><strong>Sheltered waters</strong> -- Howe Sound's fjord geography provides calmer conditions than the open ocean</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible from Vancouver</strong> -- An easy day trip from Metro Vancouver, Whistler, or anywhere along the Sea to Sky corridor</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple destinations</strong> -- Britannia Beach, Lions Bay, Porto Cove, Anvil Island, and dozens of hidden coves and beaches</li>
          </ul>
