        <div class="blog-post-body">
          <p>Howe Sound is one of British Columbia's most spectacular natural environments -- a deep glacial fjord stretching over 40 kilometres from Squamish to Horseshoe Bay, surrounded by towering coastal mountains. But beyond the breathtaking scenery, <strong>Howe Sound is home to an extraordinary diversity of wildlife</strong>. From harbour seals lounging on rocky outcrops to bald eagles soaring overhead, a <strong>wildlife viewing tour on Howe Sound</strong> is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have on the water near Vancouver.</p>

          <p>At <a href="../index.html">Squamish Water Taxi</a>, we take passengers through the heart of Howe Sound every day, and wildlife sightings are one of the highlights our guests talk about most. Here is your complete guide to the <strong>marine wildlife of Howe Sound</strong> and where to find it.</p>

          <h2 id="harbour-seals-pam-rocks">Harbour Seals at Pam Rocks</h2>

          <p>One of the most reliable and exciting <strong>wildlife viewing spots on Howe Sound</strong> is Pam Rocks, a small rocky islet located between Anvil Island and Lions Bay. This protected site is a favourite haul-out for <strong>harbour seals</strong>, and on any given day you can spot dozens of them basking on the sun-warmed rocks.</p>

          <p>Harbour seals are year-round residents of Howe Sound. They are curious, docile creatures that often pop their heads above the surface to watch passing boats. Pam Rocks is only accessible by water, making a <strong>Howe Sound wildlife tour by boat</strong> the only way to see this incredible spectacle up close. We always maintain a respectful distance to avoid disturbing the animals while still giving passengers an unforgettable view.</p>

          <p>In addition to harbour seals, <strong>Steller sea lions</strong> and <strong>California sea lions</strong> visit the waters around Pam Rocks and other rocky areas of Howe Sound, particularly during the winter and spring months. These larger marine mammals are impressive to see -- adult male Steller sea lions can weigh over 1,000 kilograms.</p>

          <h2 id="bald-eagles-squamish">Bald Eagles -- The Eagle Capital of Canada</h2>

          <p>Squamish holds the proud title of the <strong>Eagle Capital of Canada</strong>, and for good reason. Each winter, thousands of bald eagles gather along the Squamish River and Brackendale area to feed on spawning salmon. The annual Brackendale Eagle Count has recorded as many as 3,769 eagles in a single survey, making it one of the largest concentrations of bald eagles anywhere in the world.</p>

          <figure class="blog-inline-image">
            <img src="../assets/howe-sound-sunset.jpg" alt="Golden sunset over Howe Sound with mountain silhouettes near Squamish BC" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800">
            <figcaption>The waters of Howe Sound at sunset -- prime hunting time for bald eagles along the shoreline</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>While the peak eagle season runs from <strong>November through February</strong>, bald eagles are present in the Squamish and Howe Sound area year-round. From the water, you can often see them perched in tall conifers along the shoreline, circling overhead on thermals, or diving down to snatch fish from the surface. Watching a bald eagle hunt from a boat on Howe Sound is a truly unforgettable sight.</p>

          <p>Our boat tours departing from Squamish pass through prime eagle habitat, giving you a unique vantage point that most visitors to the area never experience. Whether you are on a <a href="../echo-falls.html">shuttle to Echo Falls</a> or a dedicated wildlife cruise, keep your eyes on the treetops and the sky.</p>

          <h2 id="dolphins-orcas">Dolphins, Porpoises & Orcas</h2>

          <p><strong>Pacific white-sided dolphins</strong> are among the most thrilling animals to encounter on Howe Sound. These energetic, acrobatic dolphins travel in pods and are known for riding bow waves alongside boats, leaping clear of the water, and putting on a show that delights passengers of all ages. Sightings are most common in the deeper channels of Howe Sound during the spring and summer months.</p>

          <p><strong>Dall's porpoises</strong>, sometimes called the "little orcas" for their striking black-and-white colouring, are also spotted in Howe Sound. They are among the fastest small cetaceans in the ocean and create distinctive "rooster tail" splashes as they speed through the water.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the most exciting -- if less frequent -- sighting is that of <strong>orcas (killer whales)</strong>. Transient orcas, also known as Bigg's killer whales, travel through Howe Sound several times a year, following marine mammal prey such as seals and sea lions. While orca sightings are never guaranteed, when they do appear it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Our captains always keep an eye out and will adjust the route when there are reports of orcas in the area.</p>

          <h2 id="birds-howe-sound">Herons, Cormorants & Shorebirds</h2>

          <p>Beyond bald eagles, Howe Sound supports a rich community of bird species that make <strong>wildlife viewing on the water</strong> endlessly interesting. <strong>Great blue herons</strong> are a common sight along the rocky shorelines and estuaries, standing motionless in the shallows as they wait to strike at passing fish. These magnificent birds stand nearly 1.5 metres tall and are a protected species in British Columbia.</p>

          <figure class="blog-inline-image">
            <img src="../assets/canoe-mountain-squamish.jpg" alt="Paddler on the calm waters of Howe Sound with snow-capped mountain backdrop near Squamish" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800">
            <figcaption>The calm waters of Howe Sound provide ideal conditions for wildlife viewing by boat</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Other bird species you may spot during a <strong>Howe Sound wildlife tour</strong> include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Double-crested cormorants</strong> -- often seen perched on rocks with their wings spread to dry</li>
            <li><strong>Belted kingfishers</strong> -- small, colourful birds that dive headfirst into the water to catch fish</li>
            <li><strong>Ospreys</strong> -- large raptors that hover over the water before plunging feet-first to grab fish</li>
            <li><strong>Common mergansers</strong> -- diving ducks frequently seen in groups along the shoreline</li>
            <li><strong>Pigeon guillemots</strong> -- black seabirds with bright red feet found on rocky cliffs and islets</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For birdwatchers, bringing a pair of binoculars on your boat tour is highly recommended. The variety of avian life on Howe Sound rivals some of the best birding destinations on the BC coast.</p>

          <h2 id="best-time-wildlife">When to See Wildlife on Howe Sound</h2>

          <p>One of the best things about <strong>wildlife viewing on Howe Sound</strong> is that there is something to see in every season:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Winter (November - February)</strong> -- Peak bald eagle season along the Squamish River. Sea lions are active around Pam Rocks and other haul-outs.</li>
            <li><strong>Spring (March - May)</strong> -- Migrating birds return, sea lion activity increases, and dolphins begin appearing in the deeper channels. Grey whales occasionally pass through on their northward migration.</li>
            <li><strong>Summer (June - September)</strong> -- The best all-around conditions for wildlife viewing. Harbour seals are active with pups, dolphins and porpoises are regularly spotted, and bird life is at its peak.</li>
            <li><strong>Fall (September - November)</strong> -- Salmon runs draw eagles, seals, and sea lions into the estuary. Transient orcas are more likely during this period as they follow marine mammal prey.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>No matter when you visit Squamish, a trip out on the water with <a href="../index.html">Squamish Water Taxi</a> gives you a front-row seat to the natural world of Howe Sound.</p>

          <h2 id="tips-wildlife-viewing">Tips for a Great Wildlife Viewing Experience</h2>

          <p>To make the most of your <strong>Howe Sound wildlife tour</strong>, keep these tips in mind:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bring binoculars</strong> -- Many animals are best observed from a respectful distance, and binoculars make all the difference</li>
            <li><strong>Bring a camera with zoom</strong> -- A telephoto lens or phone with good optical zoom will help you capture incredible shots</li>
            <li><strong>Dress in layers</strong> -- Conditions on the water are cooler than on land, even in summer</li>
            <li><strong>Be patient and quiet</strong> -- Wildlife is more likely to appear and stay visible when boats approach slowly and quietly</li>
            <li><strong>Listen to your captain</strong> -- Our crew knows the best spots and can identify species you might otherwise miss</li>
          </ul>
